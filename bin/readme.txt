A dump of scripts that are used for fun/rice, as seen on repeated posts on
reddit (http://i.imgur.com/pQT0l.gif)

256color.pl
	Not shown in image, makes a simple 256 color rectangle to test if
	terminals have 256 color compatability.

3spooky.lua
	Top-middle in image, if I recall correctly, some guy on 4chan posted it
	(http://pastebin.com/brwgHnCq) and I just reuploaded it here.

hack.exe
	Middle-left in image, a bash script I made when bored, might not always
	get IP addresses right, otherwise it should work for everything else.

hackertyper.sh
	Not shown in image, a shell script made to mimic http://hackertyper.com/

pipes.sh
	Top-Right in image, makes pipes. If I recall correctly it was a pretty
	old script, but it didn't work, someone had posted it on 4chan and I
	fixed it.
